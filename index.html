		<p id="tumble">
			<span class="name">Tumble</span> was an old cat who lived beneath my house.
			He had thirty-two scars each a different color.
			His active days may long be gone and he is aged and saged,
			and his three little kittens look up to him as a leader to follow or a figure to admire,
			but he may still on boresome nights be seen chasing the odd moth.

		<p id="petunius">
			A wizard named <span class="name">Petunius</span> knocked on my door at midday.
			She had a few scrolls, at least seven, and an owl on her shoulder.
			And a long pointy hat, so long that it's point and her feet could not be viewed together with a single glance.
