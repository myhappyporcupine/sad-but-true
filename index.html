				<span class="name">Tumble</span> was an old cat who lived beneath my house.
				He had thirty-two scars each a different color.
				His active days may long be gone and he is aged and saged,
				and his three little kittens look up to him as a leader to follow or a figure to admire,
				but he may still on boresome nights be seen chasing the odd moth.

				A wizard named <span class="name">Petunius</span> knocked on my door at midday.
				She had a few scrolls, at least seven, and an owl on her shoulder.
				And a long pointy hat,
				so long that it's point and her feet could not be viewed together with a single glance.
